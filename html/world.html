                            Saturday's airstrikes targeted the main camp occupied by paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in southern Khartoum, hitting the central market and a nearby residential area.
                            
                            Traders, shoppers and local residents were among the victims.</p>

                        <p>India and Canada have expelled their top envoys along with other diplomats as Justin Trudeau's government accused Indian agents of involvement in "homicides, extortion and violent acts" on Canadian soil.

                            Canadian police said the criminal activity had particularly targeted supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement which seeks a separate homeland for Sikhs in India.
                            
                            Officials said a dozen of agents had been involved, but did not confirm if they were directly linked to the June 2023 murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada..</p>

                            Ahead of the King's visit to Australia next week, the Australian Republic Movement exchanged letters with Buckingham Palace officials, writing on the King's behalf.
                            
                            Correspondence from the palace, first revealed by the Daily Mail, says that "whether Australia becomes a republic" is a "matter for the Australian public to decide".
                            
                            The future of the monarchy in Australia is likely to be an issue during the royal visit by King Charles and Queen Camilla, which includes events in Sydney and Canberra..</p>

                <p>French politician Marine Le Pen has hit back against charges of illegal funding by Euro deputies from her far-right National Rally (RN) party.

                    She told a court in Paris on Monday that parliamentary assistants paid for by the Brussels assembly were naturally involved in politics - because that was what drew them to the job in the first place.
                    
                    So, she claimed, it was a false distinction to claim that they should be working solely for the parliament.
                    
                    "Assistants work for their deputies, enlarging their ideas," Le Pen said..</p>

            <p>Passengers were left stranded when the international airport in the Caribbean island of Martinique was forced to close by unrest over the cost of living in the French territory.

                On Thursday dozens of protesters stormed the runway at the airport in the capital, Fort-de-France, prompting its closure. Inbound flights were re-directed to nearby Guadeloupe, also a French territory. The airport reopened on Friday.
                
                A curfew has been imposed until at least Monday following a wave of violent protests.</p>

                Lammy travelled to the meeting as a special guest of EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell, to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and Labour's agenda.

            <p>Now I think about it, I definitely chose the wrong industry.”

                For his first year in the job, he says he was paid almost 750,000 yuan ($106,200; £81,200). He was sure he would soon hit the million-yuan mark.
                
                Three years on, he is earning half of what he made back then. His pay was frozen last year, and an annual bonus, which had been a big part of his income, vanished..</p>
